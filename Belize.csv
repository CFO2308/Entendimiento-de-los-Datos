In the area close to the house are a few small food stalls and the nearest grocery store is a few minutes by bike.

Because we are close to the reef, there can be seagrass that washes in. However - the swimmable beaches we have - are gorgeous. All beaches in Belize are public, so you are welcome to walk freely on all the beachfront. Although many resorts are located on the beach, there are only a few spots people actually swim in the sea. Here are the popular spots to swim: <br />--You can walk right to the shore, steps away, from PUR, and walk the beautiful, picturesque beach front<br />--You can swim off the docks at Rum dog, just minutes walk away, head north on the beach <br />-- Or you can head over to Aji Tapa Bar & Restaurant at Bella Vista Resort, our sister property and use the kayaks, swim off "

This is an eco friendly area and this community is all off grid.  We supply our own power through solar and collect rain water for bathing and cleaning.  Where elegance meets conservation.
